## Case: Energy performance on buildings
Using statistical tools to identify buildings that have poor energy performance in order to prioritize them for retrofitting .
The full report of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RGUK6jgrzKGkCpdduGdgJuv8ucmFiM6U/view?usp=sharing).

## Data
The data consists of daily readings for the district heating meters of 97 buildings in the district and an hourly climate data from WUndergraound.

## Summary
The goal of this report is to use statistical methods in order identify buildings with high heat loss that can be prioritized for renovation purposes in the district. The used method is the general linear model, which coefficient outputs are used to estimate the amount of insulation for each building. The insulation parameter is used to select potential candidates for renovation. The data preprocessing and statistical modelling are performed in R.
